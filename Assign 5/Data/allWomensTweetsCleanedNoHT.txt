Saved by the challenge

Great to see  playing well Go Kuzzy Hope she goes far 

Both players in the last 2 games seemed a bit shaky with a lot of unforced errors Lets see if at happens here next

Hard fought hold for Angelique

Kerber seemed to be in full control in the beginning of the second set Now looks a bit on the back foot

Hydration is important  

Maybe Never know 

That's amazing 

I have Very talented but there is a lot more to do than just talent Hope he does well in the future 

That would be funny 

More pressure But I loved it 

I enjoy both Depends on the match 

I saw he was down a set and in the tiebreak of the second Did he win

What a finish of the year for  congrats Champ

I think in a situation like this You start clean Forget about the first set regroup and try to fight for 2 more s 

So far very composed and dominant Nice to watch

Strong break from Andy Aggressive and finding great angles Let's see if he can serve for the first set
