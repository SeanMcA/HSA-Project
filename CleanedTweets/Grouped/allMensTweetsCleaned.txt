@deusoc17 so you're tellin me what I was thinking

@thehappydaze u said 81 and I gave u somebody else that didn't have 81 and u backtracking Think before u tweet me lol

@waldorfsfinest everyday I don't think about if we are gonna win or lose a game Every single day I think about my individual skills tho

@waldorfsfinest I play for more than one reason If anybody tell u they don't then it's just a lie

@waldorfsfinest a coach is suppose to put me in position to maximize what i do best That's why more than one person wins a ring

@waldorfsfinest i play to be the best individual talent I can be that's why u work out by yourself

@JasonStateman it is

@thehappydaze mj

@channooo3 thank u lol

@waldorfsfinest if u do the eye test u would know that mac was different

@waldorfsfinest t mac could do it all Don't get it twisted He was booked in for 3065 every night Nobody could stop him bro lol

@waldorfsfinest I'm on here arguing about TMac What has the world come to guess he's not the two way player u want

@waldorfsfinest u don't know basketball so you don't get it

@waldorfsfinest he played with mutumbo when he was the oldest player in the league and grant hill got hurt a few times so did Yao

@waldorfsfinest he got traded for franchise Know your history

@waldorfsfinest oh yea I know that

@waldorfsfinest it's always been about winning U get more buckets than the other team and u win

@waldorfsfinest I don't get what u tryna say

@waldorfsfinest u like assist and rebounds right U make a pass so that u can score right U rebound an attempted shot right

@waldorfsfinest elaborate

@blazeisbaseball he wore number 1 on his jersey

The game will always be about buckets When it comes to buckets there was nobody like TMac FOH number 1 in the HOF Respect OG

HA

RT @laurenepowell A terrible day But a day that will elevate millions to stand up for #Dreamers Congress were all watching

@KingMike210 every Saturday We still talk about those stories today

@nickswish8 @NekiasNBA I feel positive about myself when I respond to negative shit lol

@BarstoolRDT you right I apologize

@BarstoolRDT you can throw jokes and it's fun but when I do it I'm in my feelings It don't work like that bro U don't have that much power

@JimWhite67 hahaha love ya man

@ballas that boy gotta sneak away from his parent to kiss his girl in the bathroom I remember bro respect 

@JustinEvans05 you bypass everything else I said when I made that statement which was made like last year probably U aren't better at this

@JustinEvans05 u pick and choose what u wanna see That's your problem

@JustinEvans05 that's exactly why I will win hahaha

@JustinEvans05 yea u don't have knowledge I won already

@TyroneSpikes @BarstoolRDT you both have other men in your profile pics

@BarstoolRDT no asshole you aren't good enough

@RipCityGoon nah son we doing this in person We watching film and everything U will be a Nba coach when we done lmao

@RipCityGoon you don't know more ball than me Bring ya friends too

@RipCityGoon you will not beat me in a Nba debate Set it up face to face chump

@SilentC @RipCityGoon @RaeJohnsonNBA he's probably driving his Lambo to the gym to work on his game Lol

@RipCityGoon the starving animal in the court is most dangerous All that other moral upbringing shit doesn't matter

@RaeJohnsonNBA u make no sense If he wants to hoop then he knows failure is a part of it

@SilentC @RipCityGoon @RaeJohnsonNBA I never starved I ain't kno I was poor until I made money I played cuz it was fun

@RaeJohnsonNBA so u think the only reason he wants to make it to the league is to get a Lambo He ain't u dawg He prolly likes to hoop

@10milekid I was lurkin round his block he was lurkin on my twitter

@RaeJohnsonNBA I don't even get what you mean

@canadianboy11 @Lazy3 @RaeJohnsonNBA ok so tell me what his career is gonna be like if it's guaranteed

@RaeJohnsonNBA no it wouldn't Push YOU to be great Speak for yourself not him U don't know that man lol

@Lazy3 @RaeJohnsonNBA he ain't making the league cuz his name He gonna make it cuz he nice

@RaeJohnsonNBA that's not true Maybe He's not playing basketball to get things

@Sonnnnnnnnnnnny @RaeJohnsonNBA I'm crying 

@RaeJohnsonNBA you don't have to struggle growing up to be a good basketball player

@RaeJohnsonNBA aww u want a Lambo too

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke bro I'm just tellin u to watch games Stop looking at stats u will learn a lot watching

@ParkerHanft just arguing over basketball Something I'll probably do for the rest of my life 

@Abdiqalis yes it does and vice versa but I'm not even the court in this pic lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke so as soon as steph walks across he gets double teamed

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke lol u got it big homie lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke ok

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke they do NOT get doubled team You got watch the games when they are on not twitter lol

@LegendToday much love bro

@HatcherSeth I get it you're hurt on a personal level sorry But we are talking about the actual game Wrong convo for u lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke why would I want to play basketball against 2 people Why should they have an advantage

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke pick and rolls causes 2 guys to guard the ball Steph plays in Pick and roll a lot

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke so u saying I'm too good to get played one on one I need a double team every play

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke nope that was just bad transition defense Not strategy

@KDTrey5 @RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke and its 96 seconds left in the half Most teams trap in pick and roll that late

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke matter fact I'm not even in the game Maybe the reason steph was trapped harder

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke issa pick and roll He only got trapped cuz it was a screen And do u see me wide open

@SK6Stan nah my narratives don't fit

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke you're tellin me Lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke I see y'all arguing just wanted to give some insight into the game 

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke nobody got double teamed the whole series Pick and rolls is 2 on 2 defense not traps

@BrandoXFSU no charge

@ThaRealRicci Tell them stop asking me questions all the damn time

RT @mavcarter This is amazing Timmy D the legend 

Can't stand for it anymore because of I  and will die right now for my Sport and for SPORTS in general #JustMyOpinion

are out there please stop worrying about u and if u really care for the kid give them the guidance as my Coaches mentors did for me

We need to be pushed kicked loved then pushed and kicked again cause that's what brings and breads the hunger inside of us Whoever u

on how much they can benefit in the long run from the kid not realizing they're cheating the shit out of the kid We as kids don't know

won't get on them because their afraid of losing the kid or losing the sponsorship that comes with the kids or have their own agenda

Reason I'm saying this is I believe this is a major part of the reason why kids don't succeed as much because the leaders coaches etc

they showed toughness and stayed on me every single day Never sugar coded nothing told me to real and lit me up when I wasn't applying

Man if it wasn't for Big Frank Bruce Kelker Willie Earl @CoachDambrot @CoachDruJoyce I wouldn't be the playerman I am today As a kid

Humbled but this goes to the parents raising teachers educating amp partners supporting my kids You're THE leaders
