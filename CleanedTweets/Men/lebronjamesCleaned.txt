are out there please stop worrying about u and if u really care for the kid give them the guidance as my Coaches mentors did for me

We need to be pushed kicked loved then pushed and kicked again cause that's what brings and breads the hunger inside of us Whoever u

on how much they can benefit in the long run from the kid not realizing they're cheating the shit out of the kid We as kids don't know

won't get on them because their afraid of losing the kid or losing the sponsorship that comes with the kids or have their own agenda

Reason I'm saying this is I believe this is a major part of the reason why kids don't succeed as much because the leaders coaches etc

they showed toughness and stayed on me every single day Never sugar coded nothing told me to real and lit me up when I wasn't applying

Man if it wasn't for Big Frank Bruce Kelker Willie Earl   I wouldn't be the playerman I am today As a kid
