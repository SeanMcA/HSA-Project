Great tiebreak from Witthoeft Kerber in my opinion got too frustrated after 32 point Cost her Will be fighting hard now for the third set

Saved by the challenge

What a point

Haven't watched the match just saw results 

Great to see  playing well Go Kuzzy Hope she goes far 

Both players in the last 2 games seemed a bit shaky with a lot of unforced errors Lets see if at happens here next

Hard fought hold for Angelique

Kerber seemed to be in full control in the beginning of the second set Now looks a bit on the back foot

Hydration is important  

Maybe Never know 

That's amazing 

I have Very talented but there is a lot more to do than just talent Hope he does well in the future 

That would be funny 

More pressure But I loved it 

I enjoy both Depends on the match
