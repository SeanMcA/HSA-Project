 I bring out the ya mama jokes on occasion Be on the look out

 scenario u tell a joke on me I laugh I make a joke about u u call me soft  makes zero sense to me Who's the soft one

  same man that uses amazon instead of going to the mall Lmao

 thank bro

  didn't know I played golf

 I now play for every team in every league Mission accomplished Winning rings every year until I retire

 I don't get this one I think u mean Atlanta or to be even funnier the patriots  HA

 so you're tellin me what I was thinking

 u said 81 and I gave u somebody else that didn't have 81 and u backtracking Think before u tweet me lol

 everyday I don't think about if we are gonna win or lose a game Every single day I think about my individual skills tho

 I play for more than one reason If anybody tell u they don't then it's just a lie

 a coach is suppose to put me in position to maximize what i do best That's why more than one person wins a ring

 i play to be the best individual talent I can be that's why u work out by yourself

 it is

 mj

 thank u lol

 if u do the eye test u would know that mac was different

 t mac could do it all Don't get it twisted He was booked in for 3065 every night Nobody could stop him brother lol

 I'm on here arguing about TMac What has the world come to guess he's not the two way player u want

 u don't know basketball so you don't get it

 he played with mutumbo when he was the oldest player in the league and grant hill got hurt a few times so did Yao

 he got traded for franchise Know your history

 oh yea I know that

 it's always been about winning U get more buckets than the other team and u win

 I don't get what u tryna say

 u like assist and rebounds right U make a pass so that u can score right U rebound an attempted shot right

 elaborate

 he wore number 1 on his jersey

The game will always be about buckets When it comes to buckets there was nobody like TMac FOH number 1 in the HOF Respect OG

HA

RT  A terrible day But a day that will elevate millions to stand up for  Congress were all watching 

 yooo that shit was crazy right Still honored til this day

 John fast as shit so he stop on the dime and it's over I can't do that I got the mini snatch lol

 Bernie sanders

 CJ McCollum dropped me off reaaaalll smooth this year I had to pay homage lol

 haaa man that snatch back was viscous 

Touched earth 

 dope Thank u

Good luck tonight my good men Bring it home 

 every Saturday We still talk about those stories today

  I feel positive about myself when I respond to negative shit lol

 you right I apologize

 you can throw jokes and it's fun but when I do it I'm in my feeling It don't work like that brother U don't have that much power

 hahaha love ya man

 that boy gotta sneak away from his parent to kiss his girl in the bathroom I remember brother respect 

 you bypass everything else I said when I made that statement which was made like last year probably U aren't better at this

 u pick and choose what u wanna see That's your problem

 that's exactly why I will win hahaha

 yea u don't have knowledge I won already

  you both have other men in your profile pics

 no asshole you aren't good enough

 brother I think about ball in my sleep U can't mess with me son

 I don't know u so I don't have a better response

 your mother

 I said basketball tough guy

ICYMI My  Live LA experience w@FirstWeFeast    

 haha yea man It's pretty funny

 lucky shot

 no chance u scoring on me

 

 nah son we doing this in person We watching film and everything U will be a Nba coach when we done lmao

 you don't know more ball than me Bring ya friends too

 you will not beat me in a Nba debate Set it up face to face chump

   he's probably driving his Lambo to the gym to work on his game Lol

 the starving animal in the court is most dangerous All that other moral upbringing shit doesn't matter

 u make no sense If he wants to hoop then he knows failure is a part of it

   I never starved I ain't kno I was poor until I made money I played cuz it was fun

 so u think the only reason he wants to make it to the league is to get a Lambo He ain't u dawg He prolly likes to hoop

 I was lurkin round his block he was lurkin on my twitter

 I don't even get what you mean

   ok so tell me what his career is gonna be like if it's guaranteed

 no it wouldn't Push YOU to be great Speak for yourself not him U don't know that man lol

  he ain't making the league cuz his name He gonna make it cuz he nice

 that's not true Maybe He's not playing basketball to get things

  I'm crying 

 you don't have to struggle growing up to be a good basketball player

 aww u want a Lambo too

 much love bro

 I get it you're hurt on a personal level sorry But we are talking about the actual game Wrong convo for u lol

    why would I want to play basketball against 2 people Why should they have an advantage

    pick and rolls causes 2 guys to guard the ball Steph plays in Pick and roll a lot

    so u saying I'm too good to get played one on one I need a double team every play

    nope that was just bad transition defense Not strategy

     and its 96 seconds left in the half Most teams trap in pick and roll that late

    matter fact I'm not even in the game Maybe the reason steph was trapped harder

    issa pick and roll He only got trapped cuz it was a screen And do u see me wide open

 nah my narratives don't fit

    you're tellin me Lol

    I see y'all arguing just wanted to give some insight into the game 

    nobody got double teamed the whole series Pick and rolls is 2 on 2 defense not traps

 no charge

 Tell them stop asking me questions all the damn time

on how much they can benefit in the long run from the kid not realizing they're cheating the shit out of the kid We as kid don't know

won't get on them because their afraid of losing the kid or losing the sponsorship that comes with the kid or have their own agenda

Reason I'm saying this is I believe this is a major part of the reason why kid don't succeed as much because the leaders coaches etc

they showed toughness and stayed on me every single day Never sugar coded nothing told me to real and lit me up when I wasn't applying
