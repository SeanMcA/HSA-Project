@CKiepert I bring out the ya mama jokes on occasion Be on the look out

@Bmaggia scenario u tell a joke on me I laugh I make a joke about u u call me soft  makes zero sense to me Who's the soft one

@incarceratedbob @Stugotz790 same man that uses amazon instead of going to the mall Lmao

@Mohsin35313 thanks bro

@Smailing07 @OGZaves didn't know I played golf

@OGZaves I now play for every team in every league Mission accomplished Winning rings every year until I retire

@zoolander8816 I don't get this one I think u mean Atlanta or to be even funnier the patriots  HA

@deusoc17 so you're tellin me what I was thinking

@thehappydaze u said 81 and I gave u somebody else that didn't have 81 and u backtracking Think before u tweet me lol

@waldorfsfinest everyday I don't think about if we are gonna win or lose a game Every single day I think about my individual skills tho

@waldorfsfinest I play for more than one reason If anybody tell u they don't then it's just a lie

@waldorfsfinest a coach is suppose to put me in position to maximize what i do best That's why more than one person wins a ring

@waldorfsfinest i play to be the best individual talent I can be that's why u work out by yourself

@JasonStateman it is

@thehappydaze mj

@channooo3 thank u lol

@waldorfsfinest if u do the eye test u would know that mac was different

@waldorfsfinest t mac could do it all Don't get it twisted He was booked in for 3065 every night Nobody could stop him bro lol

@waldorfsfinest I'm on here arguing about TMac What has the world come to guess he's not the two way player u want

@waldorfsfinest u don't know basketball so you don't get it

@waldorfsfinest he played with mutumbo when he was the oldest player in the league and grant hill got hurt a few times so did Yao

@waldorfsfinest he got traded for franchise Know your history

@waldorfsfinest oh yea I know that

@waldorfsfinest it's always been about winning U get more buckets than the other team and u win

@waldorfsfinest I don't get what u tryna say

@waldorfsfinest u like assist and rebounds right U make a pass so that u can score right U rebound an attempted shot right

@waldorfsfinest elaborate

@blazeisbaseball he wore number 1 on his jersey

The game will always be about buckets When it comes to buckets there was nobody like TMac FOH number 1 in the HOF Respect OG

HA

RT @laurenepowell A terrible day But a day that will elevate millions to stand up for #Dreamers Congress were all watching

@JimWhite67 hahaha love ya man

@ballas that boy gotta sneak away from his parent to kiss his girl in the bathroom I remember bro respect 

@JustinEvans05 you bypass everything else I said when I made that statement which was made like last year probably U aren't better at this

@JustinEvans05 u pick and choose what u wanna see That's your problem

@JustinEvans05 that's exactly why I will win hahaha

@JustinEvans05 yea u don't have knowledge I won already

@TyroneSpikes @BarstoolRDT you both have other men in your profile pics

@RipCityGoon you don't know more ball than me Bring ya friends too

@RipCityGoon you will not beat me in a Nba debate Set it up face to face chump

@SilentC @RipCityGoon @RaeJohnsonNBA he's probably driving his Lambo to the gym to work on his game Lol

@RipCityGoon the starving animal in the court is most dangerous All that other moral upbringing shit doesn't matter

@RaeJohnsonNBA u make no sense If he wants to hoop then he knows failure is a part of it

@SilentC @RipCityGoon @RaeJohnsonNBA I never starved I ain't kno I was poor until I made money I played cuz it was fun

@RaeJohnsonNBA so u think the only reason he wants to make it to the league is to get a Lambo He ain't u dawg He prolly likes to hoop

@10milekid I was lurkin round his block he was lurkin on my twitter

@RaeJohnsonNBA I don't even get what you mean

@canadianboy11 @Lazy3 @RaeJohnsonNBA ok so tell me what his career is gonna be like if it's guaranteed

@RaeJohnsonNBA no it wouldn't Push YOU to be great Speak for yourself not him U don't know that man lol

@Lazy3 @RaeJohnsonNBA he ain't making the league cuz his name He gonna make it cuz he nice

@RaeJohnsonNBA that's not true Maybe He's not playing basketball to get things

@Sonnnnnnnnnnnny @RaeJohnsonNBA I'm crying 

@RaeJohnsonNBA you don't have to struggle growing up to be a good basketball player

@RaeJohnsonNBA aww u want a Lambo too

@rawansger when 2k comes out I'm gonna set the league up It's gonna be dope

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke bro I'm just tellin u to watch games Stop looking at stats u will learn a lot watching

@ParkerHanft just arguing over basketball Something I'll probably do for the rest of my life 

@Abdiqalis yes it does and vice versa but I'm not even the court in this pic lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke so as soon as steph walks across he gets double teamed

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke lol u got it big homie lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke ok

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke they do NOT get doubled team You got watch the games when they are on not twitter lol

@LegendToday much love bro

@HatcherSeth I get it you're hurt on a personal level sorry But we are talking about the actual game Wrong convo for u lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke why would I want to play basketball against 2 people Why should they have an advantage

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke pick and rolls causes 2 guys to guard the ball Steph plays in Pick and roll a lot

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke so u saying I'm too good to get played one on one I need a double team every play

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke nope that was just bad transition defense Not strategy

@KDTrey5 @RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke and its 96 seconds left in the half Most teams trap in pick and roll that late

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke matter fact I'm not even in the game Maybe the reason steph was trapped harder

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke issa pick and roll He only got trapped cuz it was a screen And do u see me wide open

@SK6Stan nah my narratives don't fit

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke you're tellin me Lol

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke I see y'all arguing just wanted to give some insight into the game 

@RipCityGoon @SimzAdamJr @KingChaney @chrisjamke nobody got double teamed the whole series Pick and rolls is 2 on 2 defense not traps

@BrandoXFSU no charge

@ThaRealRicci Tell them stop asking me questions all the damn time
