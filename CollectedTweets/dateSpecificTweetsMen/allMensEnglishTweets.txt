2017-09-08 18:19:16,@waldorfsfinest I play for more than one reason. If anybody tell u they don't then it's just a lie

2017-09-08 18:17:50,@waldorfsfinest a coach is suppose to put me in position to maximize what i do best. That's why more than one person wins a ring.

2017-08-29 00:46:42,@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke pick and rolls causes 2 guys to guard the ball. Steph plays in Pick and roll a lot

2017-08-29 00:45:32,@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke so u saying I'm too good to get played one on one? I need a double team every play?

2017-08-29 00:43:37,@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke nope that was just bad transition defense. Not strategy

2017-08-29 00:42:29,@KDTrey5 @RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke and its 9.6 seconds left in the half. Most teams trap in pick and roll that late

2017-08-29 00:40:31,"@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke matter fact, I'm not even in the game. Maybe the reason steph was trapped harder"

2017-08-29 00:39:57,@RipCityGoon @SimzAdam_Jr @King_Chaney @chrisjamke issa pick and roll. He only got trapped cuz it was a screen. And do u see me wide open?
